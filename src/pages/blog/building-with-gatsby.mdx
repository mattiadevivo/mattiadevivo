## My journey

I used Gatsby the first time in 2020 for building my portfolio website, I used
it as main project to learn React and other many things (like DNS
configuration, Netlify, CI/CD, Bootstrap 4) and to practise JavaScript a
little bit.

I was in the last semester of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science doing great courses such as _System Administration, Full-Stack Software Development with MERN stack_ and Covid-19 gave me a lot of time for practising my web development
knowledges during that period, meanwhile I was also working on mobile development for my [thesis project](https://github.com/mattiadevivo/thermo-widget).

I became really passionate about Node.js, for the first time I was feeling that the development environment was my friend despite my previous academic experience with Java, C and PHP.
In October 2020 I got my BCs while working as Freelance Developer using Flutter, and Express.js for backend, getting in touch with other devs and client companies helped me to understand real development processes.

In May 2021 I got a good job offer as DevOps Engineer for the company where I did my BCs internship and I started working on cool microservices projects using cuttin-edge technologies like _TypeScript and Go_.
Once I started using TypeScript over JavaScript I soon realized its potentiality and started writing all my projects in TS.

During 2022 I got the possibility to work on a React + TS frontend project at work using MUI as a UI library, after some weeks I decided: _despite the small amount of free time I want to rewrite my website from JS to TS (Gatsby was 3 major version ahead the one I used)_.
I know, you're thinking `what a long and boring introduction`! But this is my first post and I want to make you know me a little bit :), now we can start with the interesting things!

## Gatsby + TypeScript

Let's setup a Gatsby project using TypeScript.

```bash
# install Gatsby cli
npm install -g gatsby-cli
# create Gatsby project with TS
npm init gatsby -ts
```

This is enough to have a Gatsby + TS working project, but let's setup other interesting things!

## ESlint + Prettier

ESlint and Prettier are _standard-de-facto_ tools for Node.js developers, especially when you have big teams is useful to have
all the members following some kind of code standards and formatting.

Generate ESlint config by using:

```bash
npm init @eslint/config
```

Install Prettier:

```bash
npm install --save-dev prettier
```

Install eslint-config-prettier:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
```

Then add `"prettier"` to the "extends" array in your `.eslintrc.*` file. Make sure to put it last, so it gets the chance to override other configs:

```json
{
  "extends": ["some-other-config-you-use", "prettier"]
}
```

## Use autogenerated GraphQL Query Types

Ensure GraphQL types are generated in `gatsby-config.ts`:

```ts
module.exports = {
  graphqlTypegen: true,
};
```

This will generate `gatsby-types.d.ts` in `src` folder every time `npm run develop` is run.

Include `gatsby-types.d.ts` in the list of patterns to be checked in `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
  "include": [
    "./src/**/*",
    "./gatsby-node.ts",
    "./gatsby-config.ts",
    "./plugins/**/*",
    "./src/gatsby-types.d.ts"
  ]
```

That's all!
