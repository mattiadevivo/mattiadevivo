const aboutData = `
Mattia, Developer and Computer Science enthusiast. Since childhood I have been interested in the IT area. I am skilled in high-level programming languages; at the moment I use JavaScript, Go, and Java but I've also worked with Python, C#, Dart, C. Thanks to the variety of my background and my current experience I am building a 360Â° knowledge of the necessary building blocks for software design, development and deployment. I am pretty confident with some Cybersecurity topics such as Cryptography, Network Security, Traffic Analysis, Penetration Testing, Mobile Security, OS security, Digital Forensics, GDPR and NIS. I am also confident with tools and practical procedures including OWASP, OpenVas, Wireshark, ntop, nmap, Recon-ng. I have proven experience in writing mobile applications with Flutter and I also like to develop Full Stack applications and websites using JavaScript frameworks and libraries such React.js, Angular 2, Express.js and Node.js or Python Django. I like both SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NOSQL (MongoDB, Cloud Firestore, Redis) environments. I am currently working in an IoT company as a DevOps Engineer and studying innovative topics such as Blockchain and Digital Asstes.
